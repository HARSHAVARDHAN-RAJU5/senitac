# AI Accounts Payable Autonomous Agent

State-driven multi-agent Accounts Payable system that autonomously ingests invoices, validates financial correctness, performs PO matching, evaluates risk using AI, routes approvals, executes payments, and maintains a full audit trail.

The system is built around a deterministic state machine with controlled AI reasoning and strict financial guardrails.

---

# Architecture Overview

The system follows a layered, state-driven architecture:

- Orchestrator controls all invoice state transitions
- Workers perform deterministic execution tasks
- Agents perform reasoning and decision mapping
- PostgreSQL stores authoritative system state
- Redis enables event-driven orchestration
- Guardrails enforce financial correctness and compliance

All state mutations occur only through the orchestrator.

# Core Concepts

State Machine Lifecycle:

RECEIVED  
STRUCTURED  
DUPLICATE_CHECK  
VALIDATING  
MATCHING  
EXCEPTION_REVIEW  
WAITING_INFO  
PENDING_APPROVAL  
APPROVED  
PAYMENT_READY  
COMPLETED  
BLOCKED  

Transitions are strictly enforced through a STATE_TRANSITIONS policy.

---

# Orchestrator

File: orchestrator.js

Responsibilities:

- Reads invoice current_state
- Selects appropriate worker
- Executes worker
- Invokes agent if reasoning required
- Validates next state
- Persists transition
- Emits next event

The orchestrator is the only component allowed to mutate invoice state.

---

# Workers (Deterministic Layer)

Workers execute financial operations:

- IntakeExtractionWorker — invoice ingestion and structuring
- DuplicateWorker — duplicate detection
- ValidationWorker — invoice validation
- MatchingWorker — purchase order matching
- ApprovalWorker — approval routing
- PaymentWorker — payment scheduling and execution
- AccountingWorker — accounting entry creation
- NotificationWorker — notifications and alerts

Workers do not perform autonomous decision-making.

---

# Agents (Reasoning Layer)

Agents perform reasoning and decision mapping:

- MatchingAgent — AI-based risk reasoning
- ValidationAgent — validation reasoning
- ExceptionReviewAgent — exception handling
- SupervisorAgent — coordination logic

Agents cannot directly update database state.

---

# Data Layer

Database: PostgreSQL  
Event Layer: Redis Streams  

Core tables:

- vendor_master
- invoices
- invoice_line_items
- purchase_orders
- goods_receipts
- invoice_state_machine
- invoice_approval_workflow
- audit_event_log

All records use organization_id for strict multi-tenant isolation.

# Guardrails and Safety Controls

The system enforces financial safety using:

- Deterministic state transitions
- Duplicate invoice detection
- PO tolerance validation
- Bank mismatch detection
- Human approval enforcement
- Immutable audit logging
- AI restricted from mutating financial state
